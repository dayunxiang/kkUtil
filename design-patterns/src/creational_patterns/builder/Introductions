Intent: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
so that the same construction process can create different representations.
把复杂的构造方法从构造过程中做更高级的抽象，这样可以通过同样的方法构造不同的对象
 
 Applicability: Use the Builder pattern when
应用场景
the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts 
that make up the object and how they're assembled
一个算法由一系列复杂的不互相依赖的对象组成
the construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed
需要适应不同的表现的构造方法
